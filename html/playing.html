<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
    of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
    the other scientific journals her work had
    appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
        The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
    since college, and the longer she spent in these
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be
    free.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
    sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
    proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
        people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
    many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
    the secrets of the llama <abbr
            title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
    outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em><i>did</i><cite>did</cite> think
    she had something better to do.</p>
